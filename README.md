Credits to **Vikashraj Luhaniwal from TowardDataScience.com** for his article on Feature Selection Using Wrapper Methods for the feature selection code I use in this  notebook. Also credits to **Dr. Tirthajyoti Sarkar from TowardDataScience.com** for  his article on How to Check the Quality of a Regression Model with Python and the code I use from his github to do the residual analysis in this notebook.

# HAI-Infections
Linear Regression Analysis on Nosocomial Infections using Dataset from an extract from the Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection Control (SENIC)

This was an assignment in my Stastical Computer Packages course at the George Washington University, and I learned a lot about feature selection using wrapper methods and machine learning techniques in Regression because of this project.

Credits to **Vikashraj Luhaniwal from TowardDataScience.com** for his article on Feature Selection Using Wrapper Methods for the feature selection code I use in this  notebook. Also credits to **Dr. Tirthajyoti Sarkar from TowardDataScience.com** for  his article on How to Check the Quality of a Regression Model with Python and the code I use from his github to do the residual analysis in this notebook.
